Bless And Eat Back End

This is half of a two part front-end/back-end Application.

This website was created for a Single black female caterer who just started their own business.

The name of the company is called Bless And Eat. The owner is Lisa Coles.

The focus of the company is to bring soul food and a love for God together.

The app allows views to check out the menu, create an account, and if an account already existed sign in.
Currently, only mock orders can be placed.


****Future Development will include:
-The ability to place live orders
-The ability to be lead to a confirmation page aftet a successful order has been processed via Paypal.
-The ability to notify the Owner when orders have been placed.



To run this app(backend):
- You will need to have rails/ruby installed on your local device.
- In order to launch backend you will need to run rails s -p 3001. This will allow the able to run on the localhost:3001 server
{The front end will be running on localhost:3000 exclusively}
-After a successful port has been set up on the back end, you are not readt to run the front-end
(see frontend README.md)


*** Since this is is a two-part app you will need to launch the front-end as well since that will be the client-side(The place where users interact with the app.)
